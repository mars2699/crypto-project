# crypto-project

The goal of this project is to predict cryptocurrency prices using
linear regression and parallelization techniques.

We will be first writing volatility equations for both Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
We will be using data from Reddit, Twitter, S&P Index, and Google search terms
as predictors.

From there, we will have least squares and autoregression models to plug data into.
Because of the size of the data sets, we will parallelize the process.
